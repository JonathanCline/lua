# Lua Fork 

This adds a CMakeLists to the source repo and constructs the basic set of targets for use with C++.

No functionality was added/modifed/removed - this fork contains purely structural changes.

The only new code file added is lua.hpp which exists purely to ease interopt between lua and C++
